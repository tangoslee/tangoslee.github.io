  <h4 class="section-heading">Introduction & Goal:</h4>
  <dd class="col-md-12 text-left">
    The clients wanted to add two major social logins to the existing site that already have own login and the Facebook
    login by SDK.
  </dd>
  <h4 class="section-heading">Role:</h4>
  <dd class="col-md-12 text-left">
    Using SDK has a benefit for implementing a specific service but it can be more complex in multiple services because
    each SDK has own specification. So, I designed new processes by OAuth2 specification and implemented.
  </dd>
  <h4 class="section-heading">Result:</h4>
  <dd class="col-md-12 text-left">
    The login process became simpler and had the same look and feel.
