        Cyrang stands for 'with Cy(cyworld.com) in Korean pronunciation'.
        It was a public section with collecting social media contents in Cyworld
        and ranking them in different categories such as, top 100 'like' today, top 100 replies etc.

    <h4 class="section-heading">Role:</h4>
    <dd class="col-md-12 text-left">
        As a Web developer, I worked with 4 colleagues.
        Designed architecture and system with them, and mainly developed back-end API system.
        At that time, web app was a part of back-end system. So HTML page was generated by server-side script.
        We had decided to separate front pages from the server side to JSON communication through an AJAX
        because we had expected our service to expand work as a web service.
        It is commonly used the way of building web app nowadays.

    <dd class="col-md-12 text-left">
        Even though making web app is more complicated to implement compared to a traditional embed way,
        we learned web app had the advantage to expand the service. Recently,
        this way became a kind of 'standard' of the way of building websites.
