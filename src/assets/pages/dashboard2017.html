    <dd class="col-md-12 text-left">
        This project goal was focusing on reducing maintenance cost with a dashboard enhancement.
        The bulk product data uploading process was very complicated and composed of 5 processes.
        Firstly, make an excel sheet, upload the excel, download the result, edit the excel sheet with the result, and
        upload the excel again. These processes were not only complex but also increasing mistake during editing files.
        Thus the goal was making the process simpler.

    <h4 class="section-heading">Role:</h4>
    <dd class="col-md-12 text-left">
        My approach was making new schema with a simple process because the legacy system was strongly coupled. The
        customers are able to upload their product to the new system, then the system automatically processes the data
        to the legacy system.

    <h4 class="section-heading">Result:</h4>
    <dd class="col-md-12 text-left">
        It was successful. 5 processes reduced to 1 process. Before the project, a specific employee was a charge of
        that task because some handling skill was needed to do it. After the project, however, any employee was able to
        do that task. Total estimated time to work was reduced as well.
