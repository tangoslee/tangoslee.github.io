        Fontrix Image Font Generator was a system that converted a text was written a specific font to a PNG image
        file. It was commonly used in websites before web fonts became popular. This project was that substitute a
        commercial font generator to an open-source fonts solution for saving maintenance cost for the license.

        Designed an algorithm, system architecture and implemented the whole system with Nginx, PHP, and Javascript.
        There was a big problem during the project. Most open-source Korean fonts only supported English and Korean but
        Chinese character was necessary for the project. So, I tried to combine Korean fonts with Chinese fonts.
        However, those two fonts used different code-pages that were a specific code set in each UTF-8 characters.
        Finally, I solved that problem using a mapping table with two different code pages.

        It was an urgent project. The project, from the design to implementation, must have had finished in a month
        because of license expiration issue. If the system had been not finished, the service would have closed it. The
        company could keep the service with a simple but useful idea.
