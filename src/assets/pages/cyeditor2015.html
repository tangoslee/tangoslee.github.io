    <dd class="col-md-12 text-left">
      Database migration integrated tens of different format of documents in a legacy into one JSON-structured post system. 
      A new editor is required for the new documents format. It has to be simple but compatible for the general features of other editors have. 
      The key feature of this editor was that if the users write a post once, they can publish to Facebook, Twitter etc at any time.

      Implemented various features for an editor from the HTML that was provided by UI developers. 
      For examples, image uploading, Youtube/Vimeo or other websites that use open-graph tags, 
      inserting an emoticon, file attachment, and publishing the post to social-media etc were implemented.

      A side by doing the project, I developed related solutions: Open-graph Tag Aggregator and OAuth Token Center.
