        This project goal was focusing on different curation for the Cyworld Photo Album. Cyworld Photo Album was the
        largest social media in Korea. A lot of Korean had managed their photos using that service for over ten years
        before the Facebook appear. We would have liked that people could look back their good memory through our
        service.

        I was responsible for developing API server for Android and iOS app. There were over 15 types of different
