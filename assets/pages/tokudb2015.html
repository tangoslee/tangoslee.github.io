    <dd class="col-md-12 text-left">
        This project goal was focusing on finishing migration in two month because of SQLServer License issues.
        One of our notable issues was that we had to migrate approximately 40TB of our social media contents from SQL
        Server and MySQL to MariaDB including converting the text format in two months.
        8~10 kinds of legacy document formats should have been converted to a new document form. We needed 3-tier
        migrating system; a target DBMS(MariaDB), converting instances (legacy format -> new form), source DBMS (SQL
        server + MySQL).

    <dd class="col-md-12 text-left">
        I was designed Document Format Convert Rule and responsible to migrate from MySQL to TokuDB.
    </dd>
    <h4 class="section-heading">Result:</h4>
    <dd class="col-md-12 text-left">
        There was no problem to horizontally scale out converting instances because we had a lot of extra servers at
        that time. The problem was the target DBMS InnoDB engine became a bottleneck. We solved the issue with
        replacing InnoDB to a TokuDB that is a write-intensive engine.
